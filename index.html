    <h2>About Crimzn</h2>
    <p>
      I've worked in traditional finance for nearly a decade and have been deep in crypto for 6+ years, through two full Bitcoin cycles. 
      I'm certified in blockchain, tokenomics, and wrapped token infrastructure — with hands-on experience building decentralized apps, integrating Solana Pay and Coinbase Commerce, and tracking wallets across multiple chains.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site is powered by GPT-4o and built entirely from scratch with crypto-first users in mind. CrimznBot delivers instant insights while I personally offer consultations for anyone serious about navigating the crypto space.

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      I am not a financial advisor, and nothing I or CrimznBot say should be taken as literal financial advice.
      This is crypto consulting — meant to guide you through the noise on X and the media.
      Use this platform as a compass, not a guarantee.
